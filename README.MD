Before introducing the interpretations for this last seminar, we would like to express that due to lack of time given our current preparation for the final exams, we could not create/modify any aspect of the GUI of our app.

- For the first exercise, we decided it would be an amazing idea to have a drop-down list, from which the user would be able to select the codec for the video conversion. Let's bear in mind that the input video format should be either .mp4, .avi, .mkv or .mov in order to be accepted by the application. 

- For the second exercise, our first idea was to allow the user to download each file from the encoding ladder separately. However, due to its impracticability, we then decided to compress all of them into a .zip file, and allow to download that file.
